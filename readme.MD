# Puppy Bowl 2023 Project

This project aims to enhance the website with a mini-game that allows potential pet adopters to build rosters of cute puppies for a "puppy bowl". The game enables visitors to create teams of puppies to compete in the "puppy bowl" and provides functionality to view the roster, see player details, and add players to the roster.
